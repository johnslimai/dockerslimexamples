# Welcome to John's DockerSlim examples

## Example 1: Analyzing a container using the DockerSlim xray command  

 1. Install and test DockerSlim

 - Download DockerSlim from here: [https://dockersl.im/](https://dockersl.im/)

Note: This example was developed on macOs 

- Create a folder and copy the files from the DockerSlim download into the folder. My folder looks like this.

![]({{site.baseurl}}//dockerslim-folder.png)


- run DockerSlim to check if it's working. 

Type `docker-slim help` into a terminal window.

Note: I added the folder path I created to the /etc/paths file.
